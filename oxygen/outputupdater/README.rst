Post Transformation Update
==========================

These scripts are for updating/adding bits of content that Ant/XSLT left out.

Usually this means forcing the copying of CSS files into the relevant theme directory without wading through mountains of Ant's annoying bullshit and without having to care what the current output  directory is.  Though it does depend on a consistent format which ends with a date and/or timestamp.  Good thing that's already my default just for general ease of use anyway ...
